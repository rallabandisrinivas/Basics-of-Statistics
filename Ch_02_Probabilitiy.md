# 📊 Understanding the Arithmetic Mean Formula

The arithmetic mean, commonly referred to as the **average**, is a fundamental concept in statistics. Let’s break down the formula for calculating the mean, as shown in **Figure 2-1**:

## 🧮 Formula for the Mean

The formula may look complex at first glance, but it’s just a step-by-step guide to calculate the mean:

### **Formula Explanation:**
1. **x**: Represents the numbers for which the mean is being calculated.
2. **x̄** (read as "x-bar"): The mean or average of the values of x.
3. **xi** (read as "x sub i"): An individual value in the set of x.
4. **n**: The total number of values in the dataset.
5. **Σ** (summation symbol): Indicates summing all specified values, from the first value (x₁) to the last value (xn).

🔢 **The Process:**
1. Add all the values of **x** together (Σxi).
2. Divide the total by the number of values (**n**).  
   *(Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{n} \) is equivalent to dividing by n.)*

## 🎯 Example: Calculating the Mean of Three Numbers

Suppose we have the numbers: **1, 3, and 5**. Using the formula:
- Let **x₁ = 1**, **x₂ = 3**, and **x₃ = 5**.
- Total number of values, **n = 3**.

Perform the calculation:
1. Add the numbers: **1 + 3 + 5 = 9**.
2. Divide the sum by **n**: **9 ÷ 3 = 3**.

Thus, the mean is **3**, as illustrated in **Figure 2-2**.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways for Using Formulas
- **🔎 Identify symbols**: Understand what each symbol represents and the operations required.
- **🧩 Substitute values**: Replace the variables with the corresponding values.
- **✅ Perform operations**: Follow the instructions to compute the result.

📘 As you advance in statistics, you’ll encounter more complex formulas, but the approach remains consistent: break it into understandable parts, substitute, and compute!
