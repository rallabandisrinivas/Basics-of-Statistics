<h2>What is Measurement?</h2> <p>Imagine you're playing a game with your friends where you measure who can jump the farthest. To decide, you take a tape measure and note how far everyone jumps. That's called measurement—you're using numbers to understand and compare things, like the length of a jump.</p> <h3>Numbers in Everyday Life</h3> <p>Numbers aren't just for math class; we use them all the time!</p> <ul> <li>At the store: The price tag tells you how much something costs.</li> <li>On a scale: It tells you how much you weigh.</li> </ul> <p>Even though some things (like colors) don't naturally have numbers, we can still assign numbers to them to keep track or organize information.</p>

<h2>Types of Data</h2> <p>Data is just a fancy word for information. Think of it as what you write down to understand things better. There are different kinds of data:</p> <h3>Nominal Data (Names)</h3> <p>Think of categories like "boys" and "girls." You could call boys “1” and girls “0” just to organize them, but these numbers don’t mean anyone is better or bigger—it’s just a way to label!</p> <h3>Ordinal Data (Order)</h3> <p>Imagine you're in a race, and you come in 1st, your friend is 2nd, and another is 3rd. These numbers show the order, but they don’t say how close or far apart you were.</p> <h3>Interval Data (Equal Steps)</h3> <p>This is like a thermometer. If it’s 20 degrees and then 30 degrees, the difference (10 degrees) is always the same amount of temperature change.</p> <h3>Ratio Data (Zero Matters)</h3> <p>This is like measuring your height. If you're 4 feet tall and your friend is 2 feet tall, you're twice as tall as your friend. Zero means there’s nothing—like zero dollars means no money.</p>
