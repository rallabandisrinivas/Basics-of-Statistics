<h2>What is Measurement?</h2> <p>Imagine you're playing a game with your friends where you measure who can jump the farthest. To decide, you take a tape measure and note how far everyone jumps. That's called measurementâ€”you're using numbers to understand and compare things, like the length of a jump.</p> <h3>Numbers in Everyday Life</h3> <p>Numbers aren't just for math class; we use them all the time!</p> <ul> <li>At the store: The price tag tells you how much something costs.</li> <li>On a scale: It tells you how much you weigh.</li> </ul> <p>Even though some things (like colors) don't naturally have numbers, we can still assign numbers to them to keep track or organize information.</p>
