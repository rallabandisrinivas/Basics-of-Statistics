<h2>What is Measurement?</h2> <p>Imagine you're playing a game with your friends where you measure who can jump the farthest. To decide, you take a tape measure and note how far everyone jumps. That's called measurement—you're using numbers to understand and compare things, like the length of a jump.</p> <h3>Numbers in Everyday Life</h3> <p>Numbers aren't just for math class; we use them all the time!</p> <ul> <li>At the store: The price tag tells you how much something costs.</li> <li>On a scale: It tells you how much you weigh.</li> </ul> <p>Even though some things (like colors) don't naturally have numbers, we can still assign numbers to them to keep track or organize information.</p>

<h2>Types of Data</h2> <p>Data is just a fancy word for information. Think of it as what you write down to understand things better. There are different kinds of data:</p> <h3>Nominal Data (Names)</h3> <p>Think of categories like "boys" and "girls." You could call boys “1” and girls “0” just to organize them, but these numbers don’t mean anyone is better or bigger—it’s just a way to label!</p>

<h2>What is Ordinal Data?</h2> <p>Ordinal data is when we put things in a certain order where higher means more of something, but we don’t know the exact difference between the steps. For example:</p> <p>Imagine you’re judging a drawing competition at school.</p> <ul> <li>1st place goes to the best drawing.</li> <li>2nd place goes to the next best drawing.</li> <li>3rd place goes to the third best drawing.</li> </ul> <p>You know the order of who did better, but you don’t know how much better the 1st drawing is compared to the 2nd or the 2nd compared to the 3rd. Maybe 1st place is slightly better, or maybe it’s way better—you can’t tell from just the ranking.</p> <h3>Everyday Examples of Ordinal Data</h3> <h4>Spicy Food Levels at a Restaurant</h4> <p>Imagine a menu with spice levels:</p> <ul> <li>1 Chili 🌶️: Mild</li> <li>2 Chilies 🌶️🌶️: Medium</li> <li>3 Chilies 🌶️🌶️🌶️: Hot</li> </ul> <p>You know that "3 Chilies" is spicier than "2 Chilies," and "2 Chilies" is spicier than "1 Chili," but you don’t know exactly how much spicier.</p> <h4>Grades in a Video Game</h4> <p>Let’s say you finish a game level, and you’re given a grade:</p> <ul> <li>A for Excellent</li> <li>B for Good</li> <li>C for Okay</li> </ul> <p>You know "A" is better than "B," and "B" is better than "C," but you don’t know how big the gap is between them.</p> <h4>Medals in Sports</h4> <p>In a race, runners win medals:</p> <ul> <li>Gold for 1st place</li> <li>Silver for 2nd place</li> <li>Bronze for 3rd place</li> </ul> <p>The order matters, but we don’t know the exact time difference between the 1st and 2nd runners or between the 2nd and 3rd.</p> <h3>What Makes Ordinal Data Special?</h3> <p>Ordinal data gives us a ranking, but it doesn’t tell us how much bigger or smaller one rank is compared to another. For instance, in the spicy food example, “Hot 🌶️🌶️🌶️” might be just a little hotter than “Medium 🌶️🌶️” or it might be way hotter—you can’t tell from the ranking alone.</p>

<h3>Interval Data (Equal Steps)</h3> <p>This is like a thermometer. If it’s 20 degrees and then 30 degrees, the difference (10 degrees) is always the same amount of temperature change.</p> <h3>Ratio Data (Zero Matters)</h3> <p>This is like measuring your height. If you're 4 feet tall and your friend is 2 feet tall, you're twice as tall as your friend. Zero means there’s nothing—like zero dollars means no money.</p>
